// todo: Inventory - Quantity Reserved - Allow multiple reservations for inventory record product
This should allow multiple systems to reserve inventory for a product, and then when the product is packed, it will remove the reservation from the inventory record.

Example: (inventory_reservations (id, inventory_id, product_sku, warehouse_code, quantity_reserved, reason))
Web Orders reserves 2 units,
POS reserves 1 unit,
Warehouse reserves 10 units for a special customer order

In InventoryTotals module, update inventory totals in RecalculateInventoryRecordsJob

inventory.quantity_reserved = 13
